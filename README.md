# ðŸ¦™ Hello World Podcast Feed Updater

A Python application that updates the [Hello World podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2mKAHUneit9BzihtBvBq4J?si=fTn8zTiNQx2Jk1yv7jPQ5A&dl_branch=1) feed based on the latest content hosted on Channel 9. The entire update process relies on GitHub Actions - there is a scheduled run that happens every day and makes sure that the latest episodes are covered.
